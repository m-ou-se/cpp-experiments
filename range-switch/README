There was a discussion on the std-proposals mailing list about
adding support for 'case ranges' in a switch. Something like:

    switch (x) {
        case  5 ... 10: stuff();
        case 10 ... 15: stuff();
    }

(Note that there's a GNU extension that allows this:
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.4/gcc/Case-Ranges.html)

Somebody mentioned that this could already be done using lambdas
and a function that calls the right one after giving it lambdas,
ranges, and x. Something like:

    range_switch(x,
         5, 10, [&](){ stuff(); },
        10, 15, [&](){ stuff(); },
    );

This is an extension of that idea: It hides the `[&](){}` syntax
from the user, and allows falling through to the next case, and
supports the 'break;' statement to prevent that.

It does, however, break the 'continue;' statement. (It behaves
just like `break;`.) So you can't continue a loop from a
range_switch within the loop.
