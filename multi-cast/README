Somebody on IRC said it'd be handy if you could write
    static_cast<A, B, C>(x)
instead of:
    static_cast<A>(static_cast<B>(static_cast<C>(x)))

multicast.cpp shows an implementation of `static_multicast`,
which does exactly this.

(You could #define static_cast static_multicast after defining
static_multicast, to allow `static_cast<A, B, C>` instead of having
to write `static_multicast<A, B, C>`.)
