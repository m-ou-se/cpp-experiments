This experiment shows how to access private members of classes you're not
friends with, without breaking the rules.

To access the private 'int secret;' of a class called 'Foo', call the macro
make_getter(Foo, int, secret) to define a function called get_secret which will
give you an int& to the 'secret' given a Foo&.
